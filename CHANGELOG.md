# Changelog

All notable user- and developer-visible changes to `gamer-ai` are recorded
here. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project does
not cut numbered releases yet, so entries are grouped by date.

**Updating this file is part of every PR.** See the
[PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) checklist and the
"Changelog" section in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Add an `## [Unreleased]`
bullet whenever a change is user- or developer-meaningful (new feature,
new config key, breaking change, bug fix, dependency change, doc-only
change to a public-facing file). Trivial commits — experiment dumps,
formatting, internal refactors with no behaviour change — can be skipped.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `POLICY_REGISTRY` and `register_policy` decorator in `framework/policies.py`; the five built-in policies (`hill_climbing`, `neural_net`, `epsilon_greedy`, `mcts`, `genetic`) are now self-describing with `POLICY_TYPE`, `LOOP_TYPE`, `VALID_POLICY_PARAMS`, and `_construct_or_resume`. `framework/training.py:_make_policy` consults the registry first and falls back to `extra_policy_types` for game-registered policies (Phase B of #224).
- Versioning + release system. `framework/version.py` resolves a
  runtime `code_version` string of the form
  `<PACKAGE_VERSION>+g<sha7>[.dirty]`; the value is persisted in every
  run's `experiment_data.json`, surfaced in the analytics summary
  table, and logged at startup by `main.py` and `grid_search.py`.
- `python main.py --version` prints the current code version without
  starting a run.
- `scripts/release.py` cuts a release: bumps `pyproject.toml` +
  `framework/version.py`, promotes `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`
  to a dated `## [X.Y.Z]` section, commits, and tags `vX.Y.Z`.

## 2026-05-18

### Added
- Contribution guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`), PR template, and issue
  templates (bug report / feature request / new game integration)
  (#223).
- SC2 reward shaping: `unit_loss_penalty`, `damage_taken_penalty`, and
  `passive_under_fire_penalty` — penalise army loss, friendly HP/shield
  damage, and standing idle while under fire (#230).
- SC2 reward shaping for small-unit selection micro (#243).

### Changed
- SC2 attack reward shaping persists across `no_op` chains until the
  agent issues a different action (#242).
- `CLAUDE.md` now documents the wall-clock interaction between
  `step_mul` and `max_apm` (#213).

---

## 2026-05-17

### Added
- SC2 `--eval` mode with configurable playback speed and per-step action
  logging (#211).
- Planning spec for the SC2 win-rate chart that will replace
  track-progress in analytics (#212).

---

## 2026-05-08

### Added
- `batch_run.sh` helper and matching grid-search configs for running
  multiple experiments back-to-back.
- Cross-run reward trajectory chart and per-experiment skipped-frame
  tracking in SC2 analytics (#193, #199).
- `sc2_neural_net` policy (TMNF-style MLP) and a massive grid-search
  template covering it (#203).
- Recursive cross-grid analytics report comparing whole grid-search
  families (#205).
- Full cross-game parameter abbreviation coverage in grid-search
  experiment naming (#204).

### Changed
- `idle_bonus` (SC2) is now unit-range aware — only granted when a
  friendly unit is inside combat range of a visible enemy (#202).
- `redo_analytics.py` now uses the shared analytics summary strategy and
  is robust to differing per-experiment reward configs (#200).
- Reward normalisation in analytics no longer amplifies small reward
  differences across runs with different reward configs (#193).

### Fixed
- Post-win SC2 rounds no longer stall: blocked-action streaks now
  trigger an army re-selection retry (#207).

---

## 2026-05-07

### Added
- `attack_move_bonus` and `click_attack_bonus` rewards for SC2
  `Attack_screen` actions (#163).
- `alert_count` observation; player and score-cumulative field names are
  now sourced from PySC2 directly rather than hard-coded by position
  (#158, #177).
- Hard-coded burst APM budget protection on top of the rolling
  token-bucket limiter (#162).
- Fail-fast validation for incompatible SC2 `policy_type` values and
  unknown `policy_params` keys (#179).
- SC2-specific cross-run charts in the grid-search summary (#181).
- CarRacing + SC2 integration / end-to-end tests, gated as a
  post-approval merge gate (#154) and scoped to relevant changed paths
  only (#174).
- `NEW BEST` SC2 log line now includes the full reward breakdown plus
  scalar outcome / reward / score (#189).
- SC2 reward shaping that discourages move-target hyperfixation; SC2
  grid-search templates re-aligned (#164).

### Changed
- Full SC2 documentation audit — `CLAUDE.md` and `games/sc2/README.md`
  synced to the current implementation (#176).
- SC2 analytics: reward-based run comparisons are now normalised across
  differing reward configs (#175).
- Movement exploration reward only fires when the target is at least
  the minimum-meaningful distance from the previous move target (#185).
- SC2 client caches action-mask `fn_id` lookups on the hot path (#178).
- `tests/README.md` no longer lists per-file test counts (they go stale
  immediately) (#191).

### Fixed
- Four root causes of poor SC2 genetic policy improvement (#157).
- SC2 genetic policy idle / `select_army` spam via available-actions
  masking (#161).
- `enemy_count_*` in SC2 observations now excludes neutral and ally
  units (#187).
- `Attack_screen` commands targeting friendly units are penalised
  (#186).

## 2026-05-06

### Added
- SC2-specific analytics plots: build order, supply cap, resource and
  army time-series; non-racing games now skip racing-only plots (#141,
  #147).
- `SC2CMAESPolicy` (`sc2_cmaes`, issue #108) and `SC2LSTMPolicy`
  (`sc2_lstm`, issue #109) (#143).
- `redo_analytics.py` — regenerate experiment analytics from saved data
  without re-running the training loop (#144).
- SC2 grid-search template and README for the CNN policy (#150).
- Rolling token-bucket APM limiting for SC2 (#148), measured in
  in-game seconds so caps are training-speed independent.
- Info-log split: compact per-episode lines, expanded reward breakdown
  on `NEW BEST` (#149).
- Rich SC2 observation preset filled out: selected-unit shields/energy,
  screen visibility fraction, anti-air density, mean weapon cooldown
  (#151).
- Azure infrastructure: VM cloud-init installs the selected game on
  boot; coordinator/worker scripts gained a `-Game` flag and route
  workers by game (#152).

### Fixed
- Post-beacon `select_army` spam in SC2 minigames; minimap beacon
  locator added to the minigame observation (#140).

---

## 2026-05-05

### Added
- Fog-of-war belief system wired into `SC2Env` (issue #111, #136).
- Rich SC2 observation preset extended with 15 missing PySC2 features
  (#135, #137).
- Two-head REINFORCE policy with available-actions masking (#131).
- `tests/README.md` with per-test rundown and runtime analysis (#134).

### Changed
- SC2 spatial action head: the 9-cell argmax is replaced with a
  continuous `(x, y) ∈ [0, 1]²` sigmoid head; `DISCRETE_ACTIONS` reshaped
  around an 8×8 grid; `no_op` is now a first-class action (issues
  #122, #126, #127; #132).

---

## 2026-05-03 – 2026-05-04

### Added
- `SC2NeuralDQNPolicy` (`sc2_neural_dqn`) with available-actions
  masking (#120, #130).
- Human-vs-AI interactive `--play` mode for SC2 (#117).
- Planning spec for the SC2 action and observation redesign (#129,
  feeds #122 / #126 / #127).

### Fixed
- Episode-length curriculum scaling is now also applied to
  `NeuralNetPolicy` in the greedy loop (#119).

---

## 2026-05-02

### Added
- `SC2GeneticPolicy` (`sc2_genetic`) with a multi-head individual
  representation — separate fn_idx and spatial heads (#113).
- Full 1v1 RL training loop against the built-in SC2 bot (#112).
- SC2 CNN policy (`sc2_cnn`) trained by isotropic evolutionary strategy
  on feature-layer pixel observations (#116).

### Changed
- `main.py` / `grid_search.py` are now game-agnostic via an adapter
  pattern; the same scripts drive every game under `games/<name>/`
  (#115).

---

## 2026-05-01

### Added
- Framework support for partial observability — belief decay and a
  scouting urge signal (#98).
- Per-game `README.md` files under `games/<name>/` documenting
  installation, setup, and policy reference, plus root README tables of
  contents (#102).

### Fixed
- Test dependency wiring and a batch of failing tests (#100).
