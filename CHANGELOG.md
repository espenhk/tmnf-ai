# Changelog

All notable user- and developer-visible changes to `gamer-ai` are recorded
here. The format is loosely based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project does
not cut numbered releases yet, so entries are grouped by date.

**Updating this file is part of every PR.** See the
[PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) checklist and the
"Changelog" section in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Add an `## [Unreleased]`
bullet whenever a change is user- or developer-meaningful (new feature,
new config key, breaking change, bug fix, dependency change, doc-only
change to a public-facing file). Trivial commits — experiment dumps,
formatting, internal refactors with no behaviour change — can be skipped.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation
- `README.md` now links directly to the
  `good first issue` filter, `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the canonical
  issue-label taxonomy, and the shared issue template now applies the
  default `triage` label on newly opened issues.
- PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) now carries a
  `Closes #<issue>` line near the top so PRs auto-close their issue on
  merge.  `CLAUDE.md` gains a **Pull requests** section requiring every
  PR description to be filled in from the template with that
  `Closes #<issue>` link.
- `CLAUDE.md` brought back in sync with the codebase:
  - Documents all six supported games (adds CarRacing, BeamNG, Assetto
    Corsa alongside TMNF / TORCS / SC2) in the intro, repository-structure
    tree, and run examples.
  - Corrects the master-config location — configs are per-game under
    `games/<game>/config/`, not a top-level `config/` directory.
  - Refreshes the **Dependencies** section for the current Poetry group
    layout (core vs `tmnf` / `tmnf-test` / `torcs` / optional `sc2` /
    `assetto_corsa`, plus CarRacing/BeamNG out-of-group deps).
  - Adds the `sc2_neural_net` policy, the `log_stats_every_n_sims`
    training param, the SC2 `--eval` mode, the `attack_friendly_penalty`
    and `small_selection_bonus` SC2 reward keys, the
    `grid_search --local-workers` / `--local-worker-stagger` flags, the
    SC2 map-access-gate env vars, and the `main.py` `--track` / `--workers`
    / `--log-level` override flags.
  - Updates the `move_exploration_bonus` / `move_repeat_penalty`
    descriptions to match the issue #253 unit-position tracking fix.

### Added
- Optional live training GUI (`--live-gui`) for both `main.py` and
  `grid_search.py`. The window updates during training (not post-run only):
  - reward-component bar chart per step with a 5-step rolling average, plus
    total step reward;
  - live observation visualizations using feature-aware layouts (scalar bars,
    x/y pair vectors, indexed strips, and quadrant grids when detected).
- **SC2 `attack_bonus` reward component** (issue #251).  New opt-in reward
  config key `attack_bonus` (default `0.0`) awards a flat bonus whenever the
  agent issues `Attack_screen` (fn_idx 3), regardless of whether the target
  is a visible enemy unit (click-to-attack) or open ground (A-move).  Acts as
  a simpler alternative to enabling both `attack_move_bonus` and
  `click_attack_bonus` separately; all three can be active simultaneously.
  The contribution is tracked as a separate `"attack_bonus"` entry in
  `reward_components` and is normalised in cross-experiment grid-search
  summaries alongside the existing attack bonus components.
- **Analytics: reward component breakdown charts** (issue #252).
  - `framework.analytics.plot_reward_component_breakdown` — diverging stacked
    bar chart (one bar per greedy sim, positive components above zero, negative
    below) written to `reward_component_breakdown.png` alongside the existing
    per-component line chart.
  - `games.sc2.analytics.plot_gs_reward_component_breakdown` — cross-experiment
    diverging horizontal bar chart (one row per experiment, showing mean per-sim
    component contributions) written to `comparison_reward_breakdown.png` in the
    grid-search summary directory and linked from `summary.md`.
- **SC2 periodic stats logging** (issue #240).  Training now logs reward
  component totals and action-frequency ratios every `log_stats_every_n_sims`
  sims (default `10`, set to `0` to disable).  Covers all four SC2 greedy
  loops (`_greedy_loop`, `_greedy_loop_cmaes`, `_greedy_loop_genetic`,
  `_greedy_loop_q_learning`).  New training param: `log_stats_every_n_sims`
  (integer, default `10`, stored in `training_params.yaml`).

### Changed
- Distributed grid-search coordinator now supports LAN-focused multi-machine
  home setups out of the box:
  - New `--bind-host` / `distribute.bind_host` to select the interface/IP the
    coordinator listens on.
  - New LAN-only default request filter (loopback/private/link-local source
    IPs only); override with `--allow-non-lan` /
    `distribute.allow_non_lan` when explicitly required.
  - Distributed runs now default to `local_workers=1`, so the driver/coordinator
    machine contributes one local worker by default while remote workers can
    join over the LAN.
- **SC2 `move_exploration_bonus` now decays explored cells** (issue #262).
  The grid-cell visit tracking added in #253 marked a cell explored *once per
  episode*, which (a) paid the agent to blanket-roam the whole screen to
  collect every per-cell bonus and (b) went permanently silent once the screen
  was covered, making *freezing in place* optimal — observed in training as
  units spamming moves everywhere and then hyperfixating in a small area. A
  cell now **expires** `move_exploration_decay_steps` env steps after the
  friendly-unit centroid last left it, so returning to a stale area is
  rewarded again and the bonus never goes silent. A stationary centroid keeps
  refreshing its own cell every step, so the anti-command-spam guarantee from
  #253 is preserved. Two new reward-config keys (both with sensible defaults,
  so existing configs keep working):
  - `move_exploration_grid_size` (int, default `8`) — cells per axis of the
    screen grid, replacing the previously hard-coded 8×8.
  - `move_exploration_decay_steps` (int, default `50`) — env steps before an
    explored cell may be rewarded again; `0` restores the previous permanent
    once-per-episode behaviour. Because the default is non-zero, the bonus can
    now pay more than `grid_size²` times per episode, increasing its effective
    magnitude versus pre-#262 runs — retune `move_exploration_bonus` if needed.

  The bundled `games/sc2/config/reward_config.yaml` is retuned to match: the
  `move_exploration_bonus` is lowered (`1.0` → `0.15`) and
  `move_exploration_decay_steps` raised (`50` → `120`) so the term re-rewards
  only genuine relocation and stays a minority contributor, and `score_weight`
  is raised (`10.0` → `100.0`) so task score dominates the shaping terms.

### Fixed
- SC2 `.SC2Map` file race when multiple PySC2 binaries boot on the same
  host (issue #254). `games.sc2.client.SC2Client._make_sc2_env` now
  routes every `SC2Env` construction through a cross-process
  *map-access gate* (`games.sc2.map_access_gate.acquire_map_access_slot`)
  that enforces a minimum 5 s gap between consecutive grants. This
  covers not only the initial worker launches but every subsequent
  SC2 reboot — distributed local workers picking up successive
  experiments, intra-run parallel-eval workers (`n_workers > 1`), and
  any future SC2 multi-instance scenarios. The gate uses an
  `fcntl.flock`-serialised timestamp file under the system temp dir
  and is tunable via two env vars:
  - `GAMER_AI_SC2_MAP_GAP_S` — gap in seconds (default `5.0`; set to
    `0` to disable, e.g. for single-process runs).
  - `GAMER_AI_SC2_MAP_LOCK_PATH` — custom timestamp-file path (mainly
    useful for tests).

  As a complementary defence-in-depth, `grid_search.py --distribute
  --local-workers N` also launches the local worker subprocesses with a
  cascading 5 s delay (first immediate, second waits 5 s, third waits
  another 5 s, …). Tunable via the new `--local-worker-stagger` CLI
  flag or `distribute.local_worker_stagger` config key (default `5.0`;
  set to `0` to disable).
- `move_exploration_bonus` exploit: bonus now tracks actual unit centroid
  positions on an 8×8 screen grid rather than move command targets, so
  spamming `Move_screen` to many locations without moving units yields no
  repeated reward. Grid cells are marked visited whenever friendly units are
  visible, and the bonus fires at most once per grid cell per episode.

### Added
- **SC2 intra-run parallel evaluation** (issue #229).
  Population-based SC2 policies (`sc2_genetic`, `sc2_cmaes`, `sc2_lstm`,
  `sc2_cnn`) can now evaluate individuals concurrently across multiple
  local SC2 binaries.  Set `n_workers > 1` in `training_params.yaml`
  to spawn a persistent worker pool (one SC2 env per worker, spawn
  start method) — each generation's offspring are scored in parallel
  while the distribution update remains generation-synchronous (genetic
  and cmaes loop dispatch).
  New config keys: `n_workers` (default `1`),
  `worker_start_stagger_s` (default `5.0`),
  `worker_warmup_timeout_s` (default `90.0`),
  `worker_base_seed` (default `0`).  See the *Intra-run parallel
  evaluation* subsection in `CLAUDE.md` for sizing guidance.
- `framework.parallel_eval.ParallelEvaluator` — game-agnostic worker
  pool used internally by `train_rl` when `n_workers > 1`.
- Versioning + release system. `framework/version.py` resolves a
  runtime `code_version` string of the form
  `<PACKAGE_VERSION>+g<sha7>[.dirty]`; the value is persisted in every
  run's `experiment_data.json`, surfaced in the analytics summary
  table, and logged at startup by `main.py` and `grid_search.py`.
- `python main.py --version` prints the current code version without
  starting a run.
- `scripts/release.py` cuts a release: bumps `pyproject.toml` +
  `framework/version.py`, promotes `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`
  to a dated `## [X.Y.Z]` section, commits, and tags `vX.Y.Z`.
