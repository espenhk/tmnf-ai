@dataclass
class RewardConfig:
    """
    All reward weights in one place.

    Signs:
        Positive weights add reward (encourage the behaviour).
        Negative weights subtract reward (penalise the behaviour).

    The canonical training values live in config/reward_config.yaml (copied into
    each experiment directory on first run).

    Python defaults are kept for backward compatibility and lightweight unit tests.
    Training should still load YAML via RewardConfig.from_yaml().

    Parameters
    ----------
    progress_weight:
        Reward proportional to how far along the track the car advanced this step.
        Large value because this is the primary objective.
    centerline_weight:
        Penalty coefficient for lateral deviation from the centreline (negative).
        Penalty = centerline_weight * |lateral_offset| ** centerline_exp
    centerline_exp:
        Exponent for the centeline penalty (default 2 = quadratic).
        Small drifts are forgiven; large drifts are heavily penalised.
    speed_weight:
        Small reward per m/s to break ties and encourage not braking unnecessarily.
    step_penalty:
        Tiny negative reward every tick so the agent prefers finishing fast.
    finish_bonus:
        One-time bonus when track_progress reaches 1.0.
    finish_time_weight:
        Additional bonus/penalty relative to par_time_s.
        Negative weight means slower = more negative reward.
    par_time_s:
        Reference lap time in seconds for the finish_time_weight calculation.
    accel_bonus:
        Flat reward every step the throttle is pressed.
        Prevents the policy from preferring coast actions.
    airborne_penalty:
        Applied when the car has ≤1 wheel in contact AND vertical_offset ≤ 0
        (below or beside the centreline — not a legitimate jump).
    lidar_wall_weight:
        Penalty = lidar_wall_weight * (1 - min_ray)^2, where min_ray is the
        nearest wall distance normalised to [0, 1].  Set to 0.0 when n_lidar_rays=0.
    crash_threshold_m:
        The env ends the episode when |lateral_offset| exceeds this (metres).
