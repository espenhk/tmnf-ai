"""Abstract base class for game environment integrations.

Game integrations subclass BaseGameEnv and implement its abstract interface.
In practice, subclasses must implement ``_build_obs`` and may override the
optional default hooks for game-specific info and episode time limits.  The
framework layer only ever holds a reference of type BaseGameEnv and never
imports from games/.

Relationship to Gymnasium
--------------------------
BaseGameEnv inherits gymnasium.Env so game envs are drop-in compatible with
standard RL tooling (SB3, Gymnasium wrappers, etc.).  Concrete subclasses
still define observation_space and action_space in __init__ as usual.

    """Abstract base for game-specific Gymnasium environments.

    The framework training loop interacts exclusively via this interface.
    Game integrations live in games/<name>/ and inherit this class.

    Concrete subclasses must implement:

    _build_obs(step)
        Build the float32 observation array from the current game state.
        The shape must match self.observation_space.

    _get_game_info()
        Return a dict of game-specific metrics for the current step.
        These are merged into the Gymnasium step *info* dict and are
        available to game-specific analytics without any framework coupling.

        Recommended keys for TMNF-like racing games:
            "pos_x", "pos_z" — for bird's-eye trajectory plots
            "track_progress" — fraction of track completed [0, 1]
            "laps_completed" — cumulative lap count
            "lateral_offset" — metres from centreline

    The base class provides no-op default implementations that return
    empty values so subclasses can implement incrementally.
