"""Self-play opponent management for multi-agent RL training.

Three modes
-----------
exact :
    Opponent is always an exact snapshot of the current champion policy.
    Refreshed at the end of each training generation / episode.
mutated :
    Opponent is a slightly mutated copy of the current champion.
    Mutation strength is controlled by *mutation_scale*.
    Refreshed at the end of each training generation / episode.
top_n :
    Maintains a pool of up to *top_n* historical champion snapshots.
    The pool grows whenever the champion improves; when at capacity the
    weakest snapshot is replaced if the new champion scores higher.
    A uniformly random pool member is selected as opponent each generation.

Usage
-----
In the training loop::

    manager = SelfPlayManager(mode="top_n", top_n=5)
    env.set_opponent_policy(manager.build_initial_opponent(policy))

    for gen in range(n_generations):
        rewards = evaluate(policy)
        improved = policy.update(rewards)
        new_opp = manager.step(policy, improved)
        if new_opp is not None:
            env.set_opponent_policy(new_opp)
