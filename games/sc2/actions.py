"""StarCraft 2 action definitions.

PySC2's full action space is parameterised: ``function_id`` + per-arg target
coordinates.  That doesn't fit the existing ``Discrete(N)`` policies cleanly,
so this MVP exposes a flat discrete subset for tabular / discrete-output
policies.  Continuous target coordinates are emitted directly by the
multi-head linear / CMA-ES / LSTM policies.

Action representation
---------------------
Each row in ``DISCRETE_ACTIONS`` is a 4-vector ``[fn_idx, x, y, queue]`` where:

  ``fn_idx``   — integer index into ``FUNCTION_IDS`` below.
  ``x, y``     — normalised screen target coords in ``[0, 1]``.  Ignored for
                 functions that don't take a screen-point arg.
  ``queue``    — 0 or 1, whether to queue the order.

The framework's discrete-action policies still see fixed-shape rows; the
client (``games.sc2.client``) is responsible for translating each row into
a real ``actions.FunctionCall`` at execution time.

Layout (issue #276)
--------------------
Function IDs are processed in ascending order.  Spatial fn_ids (names ending
in ``_screen`` or ``_minimap``) receive a full N×N grid of target rows; all
other fn_ids (quick-cast, select_army, no_op, …) receive a single centre row.
This gives a uniform **[command × location]** structure: all spatial commands
have identical positional coverage.

Function-ID encoding
--------------------
Names in ``FUNCTION_IDS`` must be valid ``pysc2.lib.actions.FUNCTIONS``
attribute names.  Unknown names resolve to ``no_op`` gracefully via
``getattr(..., no_op)`` — a wrong name is a silent no-op, never a crash.

Action-call encoding by fn_name pattern (see ``action_to_function_call``)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ``no_op``                  → ``FunctionCall(fn_id, [])``
- ``select_army`` / ``select_idle_worker``
                             → ``FunctionCall(fn_id, [[0]])``
- ``select_point``            → ``FunctionCall(fn_id, [[0], [sx, sy]])``
- ``select_rect``             → ``FunctionCall(fn_id, [[0], [sx,sy],[sx,sy]])``
  (degenerate rect = single-point click)
- names ending in ``_quick`` (all train/morph/ability quick-casts)
                             → ``FunctionCall(fn_id, [[queue]])``
- everything else (``_screen`` / ``_minimap`` spatial)
                             → ``FunctionCall(fn_id, [[queue], [sx, sy]])``

Race gating
-----------
``fn_ids_for_race(race)`` returns the subset of ``FUNCTION_IDS`` keys
applicable to *race* (``"terran"``, ``"protoss"``, ``"zerg"``,
``"random"``).  Policies that know their race can permanently mask the
irrelevant fn_idx scores to ``-inf`` so the agent never wastes capacity
learning that a Terran cannot build a Hatchery.
