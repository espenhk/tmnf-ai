"""Cross-process gate enforcing a minimum gap between SC2 map-file accesses.

Workaround for issue #254: when multiple PySC2 binaries boot at roughly
the same time (typically a ``grid_search.py --distribute --local-workers
N`` run, or an intra-run ``n_workers > 1`` pool) they race to read the
same ``.SC2Map`` file and one or more of them occasionally fails with a
"map not found" error.

The Popen-time stagger in ``grid_search._launch_local_workers`` only
spaces out the *initial* subprocess launches; every subsequent SC2Env
construction in those workers (one per experiment for distributed
workers, plus every parallel-eval worker startup) hits the race again.
This module guarantees a minimum gap between every SC2Env construction
on the same host, for the full lifetime of the grid-search run.

Usage::

    from games.sc2.map_access_gate import acquire_map_access_slot
    acquire_map_access_slot()        # blocks if needed, then returns
    sc2_env.SC2Env(...)              # safe to boot now

Behaviour:

* Maintains a single timestamp file (path from
  ``GAMER_AI_SC2_MAP_LOCK_PATH``, default ``<tempdir>/gamer-ai-sc2-map-access.lock``)
  storing the wall-clock time of the most recent grant.
* Each caller takes an exclusive ``fcntl.flock`` on the file, computes
  ``wait = (last + gap_s) - now``, sleeps that long if positive, writes
  the new ``now`` timestamp, and releases the lock.
* Because the sleep happens *while holding the lock*, callers are
  serialised: the next caller cannot read a stale timestamp and skip the
  wait.
* The gap defaults to 5.0 s and can be overridden per-process via
  ``GAMER_AI_SC2_MAP_GAP_S`` or per-call via the ``gap_s`` argument. A
  value of ``0`` disables the gate entirely (no I/O, no sleep).

Cross-platform: ``fcntl`` is POSIX-only. On Windows the gate falls back
to an unconditional ``sleep(gap_s)`` (single-process best-effort) and
logs a warning — the multi-worker SC2 scenario this fixes runs on Linux
in practice (see ``CLAUDE.md`` SC2 setup notes).
