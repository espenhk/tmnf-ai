"""StarCraft 2 reward calculator.

For minigames the canonical signal is the cumulative ``score`` returned by
PySC2 itself — so the calculator's main job is to compute the score *delta*
each step and add small shaping terms.  For the ladder game stub the same
signal is used as a placeholder; richer reward shaping (kill credit, mineral
income, supply lead) is left for the follow-up issue that adds learning.

@dataclass
class SC2RewardConfig:
    """Reward weights for the SC2 environment.

    Python defaults match a sensible baseline for ``MoveToBeacon``.  Other
    minigames will typically want a different ``score_weight`` because the
    environment-provided score scales differ (e.g. mineral count vs.
    beacon-touch count).

    Parameters
    ----------
    score_weight :
        Coefficient on the ``score`` delta returned by PySC2 each step.
    win_bonus :
        One-shot bonus when the player reward signals a win (>0 from PySC2).
    loss_penalty :
        One-shot penalty when the player reward signals a loss (<0).
    step_penalty :
        Tiny negative reward every tick — discourages indefinite no-op.
    idle_penalty :
        Per-step penalty when ``army_count == 0 and food_used < food_cap``;
        used by ``BuildMarines`` to discourage doing nothing.
    idle_bonus :
        Per-step bonus awarded when the agent issues ``no_op`` *and* friendly
        units are within effective attack range of an enemy on the screen
        (issue #127).  The gate applies at 95% of max range so idling exactly
        at the edge is not rewarded. Default ``0.0`` — opt-in.  Makes the
        "stand still so units can shoot" lesson learnable rather than only
        discoverable through luck. Requires screen summary features and, for
        unit-aware range gating, ``self_attack_range_px`` from the client.
    attack_move_bonus :
        Per-step bonus awarded when the agent issues ``Attack_screen``
        (fn_idx 3) *and* the click target is **not** on a visible enemy unit
        (i.e. the attack lands on empty ground — an A-move command).
        Encourages the unit to patrol-attack rather than plain-move past
        enemies.  Default ``0.0`` — opt-in.
    click_attack_bonus :
        Per-step bonus awarded when the agent issues ``Attack_screen``
        (fn_idx 3) *and* the click target is close to the enemy centroid on
        screen — i.e. a direct click-to-attack on a visible enemy unit.
        Should typically be set slightly higher than ``attack_move_bonus`` to
        prefer precision targeting.  Subject to ``click_attack_cooldown_steps``
        to discourage very rapid target-switching.  Default ``0.0`` — opt-in.
    click_attack_cooldown_steps :
        Minimum env steps that must elapse before a ``click_attack_bonus`` is
        awarded again when the agent switches to a *new* attack target (one
        that is more than ``_CLICK_ATTACK_RADIUS_FRAC`` of the screen away
        from the previous target).  Targeting the *same* unit (same vicinity)
        always fires immediately — the cooldown only penalises rapidly bouncing
        between different enemies.  Default ``8``.
    economy_weight :
        Coefficient on (minerals + vespene) delta.  Useful for economy
        minigames.  Set to 0 for pure-combat minigames.
    move_exploration_bonus :
        Per-step bonus awarded when a ``Move_screen`` command is issued and
        the current friendly-unit centroid is in a grid cell that is
        currently **unexplored**.  The screen is cut into a
        ``move_exploration_grid_size`` × ``move_exploration_grid_size`` grid
        (default 8×8 → cells ~1/8 of the screen wide).  A cell becomes
        explored as soon as the centroid enters it (regardless of action
        type) and stays explored while the centroid keeps refreshing it; it
        **expires** ``move_exploration_decay_steps`` env steps after the
        centroid last left it, becoming eligible to be rewarded again on a
        later return.  Units must be visible (``screen_self_count > 0``).
        This blocks the command-spam exploit — a stationary centroid keeps
        refreshing its own cell so spamming moves from one spot earns nothing
        — while the decay prevents the bonus from going permanently silent
        once the whole screen has been covered (which otherwise makes
        freezing in place optimal).
    move_exploration_grid_size :
        Side length of the square screen grid used by
        ``move_exploration_bonus`` (number of cells per axis).  Default ``8``
        (cells ~1/8 of the screen).  Higher = finer cells / smaller meaningful
        relocation; lower = coarser.
    move_exploration_decay_steps :
        Number of env steps after which an explored cell expires and may be
        rewarded again on a return visit (measured in env steps, like
        ``click_attack_cooldown_steps``).  ``0`` disables decay, restoring the
        permanent "once per cell per episode" behaviour.  Larger values keep
        an area "explored" for longer, reducing how often re-visits are
        rewarded.
    move_repeat_penalty :
        Per-step penalty when a ``Move_screen`` command targets a point that is
        less than ``_MOVE_MIN_MEANINGFUL_FRAC`` of the screen away from the
        previous move target (covers both exact repeats and tiny stutter
        steps).
    move_self_penalty :
        Per-step penalty when a ``Move_screen`` command targets the centroid of
        currently-visible friendly units (a common "keep moving to where we
        already are" failure mode).
    attack_friendly_penalty :
        Per-step penalty when the agent issues ``Attack_screen`` (fn_idx 3)
        *and* the click target lands on or near the centroid of currently-visible
        **friendly** units.  In-game this issues an attack command against an ally
        (friendly fire), causing units to shoot team-mates to death.  The penalty
        fires whenever ``screen_self_count > 0`` and the target pixel is within
        ``_ATTACK_SELF_RADIUS_FRAC`` of the friendly centroid.  Set to a large
        negative default to strongly discourage this behaviour.
    unit_loss_penalty :
        Penalty per unit lost this step (army_count drop).  Applied when
        ``army_count < prev_army_count``.  Scaled by the number of units lost
        so losing two units at once yields twice the penalty.  Default ``0.0``
        — opt-in.  Requires ``prev_army_count`` in info (set by ``SC2Env``).
    damage_taken_penalty :
        Penalty per raw HP+shield point lost this step across all visible
        friendly units.  Computed from ``feature_units`` health+shield sum
        delta (``prev_total_self_hp - total_self_hp``).  Only visible units
        contribute, so units that leave the camera frame can cause false
        positives; keep the weight small.  Default ``0.0`` — opt-in.
    passive_under_fire_penalty :
        Per-step penalty applied when enemy units are within effective attack
        range of friendly units **and** the agent did not issue ``Attack_screen``
        (fn_idx 3).  Encourages the agent to fight back rather than run or idle
        while taking fire.  Uses the same range gate as ``idle_bonus``
        (``self_attack_range_px`` from info, or the screen-fraction fallback)
        but without the 95% inside-margin so the penalty fires at the full
        attack range.  Default ``0.0`` — opt-in.
    small_selection_bonus :
        Per-step bonus for issuing unit-targeted commands with a small active
        selection (``selected_count == 1`` or ``selected_count`` less than 50%
        of ``visible_self_unit_count``).  Encourages micro-style control of one
        or a few units rather than always commanding the full visible army.
        Default ``0.0`` — opt-in.
    attack_bonus :
        Per-step bonus awarded whenever the agent issues ``Attack_screen``
        (fn_idx 3), regardless of whether the target is on an enemy unit
        (click-to-attack) or on open ground (A-move).  A simpler alternative
        to enabling both ``attack_move_bonus`` and ``click_attack_bonus``
        separately; all three can be active at once.
        Default ``0.0`` — opt-in.
